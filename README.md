# Prototype 2 Design Journal

This week's prototype builds upon an independent study project I began last semester. More specifically, the independent study project was carried out to explore methods of environmental storytelling, particularly within the context of a theme park queue. Of note, theme park queues are often more than simply an efficient way to direct crowds of people; rather, they also act as a vehicle for backstory, transitioning guests from the outside theming of the park, to the interior diegetic world within which the ride exists. Bearing this in mind, the hypothesis explored, both by that initial independent study project, and this prototype that builds upon it, is if the provided information and environment 1) prevents guests from becoming bored while they wait and 2) if the information, fleeting and incomplete as it is, is sufficient for guests to understand the genre, theme, and broad context for the ride upon which they are about to embark.

At the end of last semester, the experience was playable, however I did not have sufficient time to add more dynamic elements that I had otherwise initially planned for. This includes flickering light effects, audio, and models that move within the environment to create great visual interest as well as simulate the experience of an actual theme park queue. The initial experience was also designed to be played over the course of half an hour, whereas this version has been tweaked to only require five minutes. Finally, a handful of aspects of been adjusted based on best practices information acquired in this class (such as using Fixed Update).

Note: Though the modelling and graphic design for this project is wholly original, many of the textures, photographs, and audio files used to flesh out the experience are sourced from the internet. For a complete list of asset sources, please refer to AssetSources.PDF.

Questions for Playtesters:

1) Did you become bored at any point during the experience?

2) Did you have a favourite part of the experience? If so, which part and why?

3) Did this experience make you want to ride the attraction that would follow it?

4) As best you can, please try to describe the genre, theme, or backstory of the ride that would follow this queue.

5) This prototype has known frame rate issues. Could you please outline, as specifically as possible, any issues you may have had with lag or jittery frame rate.
